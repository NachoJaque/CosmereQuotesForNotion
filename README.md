# Work In Progress

* The idea would be to store some quotes from the Cosmere Books from Brandon Sanderson, initially i just look up some quotes from some pages but probably i will end up with just the ones that i remember from the ones i already read.

* If i don't lose motivation on this one i will try to implement the button to change the colors for a light or dark theme for notion that other Widgets have, as well as maybe give it the option to have a different image for every quote on the background.
